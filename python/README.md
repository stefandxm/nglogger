logviewer.py was an attempt of making a ui for nglogger.
beacuse of npyscreen just didnt work it was cancelled.


I'll leave it here for now in case npyscreen comes around.

dump.py needs the nglogger python library, code is in the src folder
and there is a messy cmakelists.txt that can be used to build it,
but mainly because of building issues with python versions and boost
i decided to keep it away from the main cmakelists for now.
